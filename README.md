## Data Collection and Preparation
- **Gather Data**: Historical customer energy consumption and market price components.
- **Data Quality**: Check for missing values, outliers, and consistency.
- **Data Integration**: Combine datasets to match energy consumption with price data.

## Model Setup with Prophet
- **Environment Setup**: Install and configure Prophet in Python/R.
- **Time Series Dataset**: Create a dataset with dates, energy consumption, and price data.

## Model Training
- **Define Model**: Configure Prophet model considering holidays and events.
- **Training**: Use historical data for model training.
- **Model Configuration**: Set growth (linear or logistic) and seasonality (daily, weekly, yearly).

## Model Evaluation
- **Data Splitting**: Use training and testing sets for performance validation.
- **Metrics**: Employ MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE for accuracy assessment.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust seasonality, change points based on performance.

## Prediction
- **Forecasting**: Predict future energy prices using usage patterns and market trends.
- **Prediction Period**: Generate forecasts for the desired future timeframe.

## Implementation and Monitoring
- **Business Integration**: Apply predictions in decision-making, like budgeting and pricing.
- **Model Updates**: Regularly update the model with new data.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously track model performance and adjust as needed.

## Reporting and Action
- **Reporting**: Develop reports or dashboards for stakeholders.
- **Strategic Use**: Leverage forecast insights for business strategy and operations.
